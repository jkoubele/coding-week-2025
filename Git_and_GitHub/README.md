# Git and GitHub

## Introduction

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed versioning system.
- **Versioning system** means that git tracks versions of your code (or any other files).
    - It can create snapshots of you code (called **commits**), so you can go back and forth
      between them if needed.
    - You can also work on multiple versions of your code (called **branches**) in parallel.
- **Distributed system** means that git repository (folder with files tracked by git) can
  be located at multiple places (computers). Git allows you to easily synchronize changes between these locations.
    - One of the locations is usually a cloud repository, accessible via internet. You can host your git repositories
      on services like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
      or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
    - Git becomes indispensable when you collaborate on larger project with other people. It allows all team members
      to share the same codebase, work on their versions (branches) and merge together the changes done by different
      people.
